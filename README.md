## Abstract

It is great that we live in a technological climate where we can rapidly develop tools to deploy large scale systems without the need for configuring servers, at very low cost and with historically low effort. It is also great that developers are inheriting this new world. Saying this, it is also very easy to make life hard for yourself if you don't step back and apply some code project patterns as you go. So what patterns can be used to stop a complicated mess?

From the perspective of a developer who has moved into infrastructure build in the cloud, this talk will go over:
 - Serverless patterns in AWS that can be used to orchestrate the creation and clean-up of highly scalable systems using Python,
 - Go over tools to maintain code quality and kill project smells,
 - How you can scale your libraries as things get more complex.
